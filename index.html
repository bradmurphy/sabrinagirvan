                <p class="desc">For 15 years I have experienced the amazing results in what I feel is the way to attain optimum health. At 45 years of age I pursued my certification as a Personal Trainer and love the art of body mechanics and the benefits of targeted exercise.</p>

                        <p class="justify">Most of my life I have been an active person. My passions in my youth were ballet and tap, but I have always loved various styles of dance. As I approached high school I progressed into sporting activities. Unfortunately for me, due to genetics and poor diet I began gaining weight. And of course this was at a time when you are young and vulnerable—the worst time for this to occur. I found the courage and strength to start making changes in my eating habits as well as increasing my exercise. As we read about our nation’s issues with childhood obesity — I share a very personal experience with this struggle.</p>

                        <p class="justify">Having committed to a new change in lifestyle and in attaining my goal weight –I realized it was not enough. Through the process I had gained confidence and discipline…and I absolutely loved the new “Me!” (Not to mention my new body). I began a new journey—and ventured into the world of Resistance/Strength Training. I engaged a Personal Trainer for correct techniques in weights, strength and cardio training and the best way to attain over-all health and well being. This is where I became a huge enthusiast and knew that I would need to share my excitement!</p>

                        <p class="testimonial-text">Sabrina's enthusiasm is contagious and her level of professionalism is unique--as it would have to be to encourage the multitude of personalities she encounters each day. I happen to be one of those unique personalities-I was not sold on the entire personal trainer thing and certainly did not have the time to be as dedicated as I should have been in the beginning. Her willingness to share her expertise and the way she effortlessly moves you through each technique for each exercise encouraged me to keep showing up! I am impressed with her perseverance and dedication to her art. I started out making it to the gym twice a week and after a year I am there 3 times a week for weights and 4-5 times a week for Cardio! Who would have guessed that she would slowly motivate me to start making "me" a priority? And somehow along the way...I am feeling and looking better than I have in years!</p>

                        <p class="testimonial-text">I have always worked out and I joined my local gym in 2010. It wasn’t until 2011 that I decided to give personal training another try. I had tried personal training , but was not happy with the trainers that I had. As you can imagine, I was skeptical to try it again due to my past experience.However, from the moment I met Sabrina, I knew she was a person that could help me achieve new goals and also the one that would help change my life for the better. I have been challenged and pushed by Sabrina, and she has taught me a great deal. She makes working out fun and inspires me to reach new goals. I have been very impressed by her passion to help clients, her knowledge, and her ability to connect with her clients. It’s because of her that I have continued to renew my sessions the last two years. My body has changed dramatically and people have complimented me on my positive change.</p>

I have 50 year old knees, so leg exercises have to specific for me. She has absolutely improved my leg strength and mobility tenfold. I have no more knee pain and for the first time in my life, I LOVE TO EXERCISE!</p>

                        <p class="testimonial-text">I would like to highly recommend Sabrina Girvan as a fitness trainer. She has been my personal trainer for 10 months and I love my results. My goal was not necessarily weight loss but weight redistribution and it has worked. My clothes fit better and I feel much better! Sabrina has a true gift of keeping our training regimen fresh and new. I am never bored with my workouts because her conversation keeps my attention away from the workout. Many times I have thought I could not do something but because I trust her to know my limits I do so many things I never would have done had I been by myself. My strength and endurance has multiplied exponentially and, again, I would never have gotten this far without her encouragement, her knowledge and her enthusiasm. If you are looking for a fun workout with great results you will want to include Sabrina in your training regimen!</p>

At home, Sabrina spends her free time in searching for new routines and new ways to make sure that my fat does not maintain the hold of me. Using and combining current world wide exercise routines and my set of personal goals, no session goes by without 100% of intensity, integrity and purpose. In addition Sabrina's in depth knowledge of muscles and bones allows us to select the programs that avoid pressure on body parts where I had my injuries in the past. I trust Sabrina all the way and all the time!</p>

                        <p class="testimonial-text">I have been working with my personal trainer since September 2011 and am pleased with the results. The trainer is technically knowledgeable and very professional. She has shown me proper form and a multitude of exercise movements that I have never done before. However, what I appreciate most about the trainer is the personal interest that they take in your development. I never feel pressured or rushed, and I am never made to feel dumb or fat. The trainer is very encouraging and seems to take genuine pleasure in my small victories. I would recommend my trainer to anyone who wants to take their fitness to another level.</p>

                        <p class="testimonial-text">After too many years of too little physical activity, I started coming to the gym four days a weeks 2 years ago. I knew I needed the discipline of an appointment with a trainer to keep me on track and to get me out of bed early on those days I’d rather not. My goals were basic – lose some of that flab around my middle-aged middle, keep my blood pressure and cholesterol at levels that keeps my doctor happy, and to improve my overall muscle tone and energy level.I was fortunate enough to start training with Sabrina about 16 months ago and couldn’t be happier. She is very knowledgeable and takes the time to research and incorporate exercises that accommodate the limitations of my, let’s say, “more mature” joints.</p>
